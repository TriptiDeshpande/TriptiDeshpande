## 🎯 What Drives Me

My motivation stems from a strong interest in **how intelligent embedded systems impact human safety** in modern mobility. I’m deeply passionate about:

- **Designing robust embedded systems for real-time applications**
- **Bridging the gap between software functionality and functional safety**
- **Learning how systems think — and helping them think safer, faster, and better**

I believe in building with clarity, engineering with empathy, and thinking in systems.
