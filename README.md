## 🔧 About Me

I’m an **aspiring Embedded Software Engineer** with a specialized academic background in **Smart, Connected & Autonomous Vehicles and an evolving professional focus on **Automotive Functional Safety, Embedded Software Development, and IoT systems**.

My core strengths lie in:

- Low-level embedded programming (C & Python)
- Automotive communication protocols (CAN, UART, SPI, I2C)
- IoT architectures and real-time interfacing (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Model-based development using MATLAB/Simulink
- ISO 26262 aligned functional safety processes

## 🎯 What Drives Me

My motivation stems from a strong interest in **how intelligent embedded systems impact human safety** in modern mobility. I’m deeply passionate about:

- **Designing robust embedded systems for real-time applications**
- **Bridging the gap between software functionality and functional safety**
- **Learning how systems think — and helping them think safer, faster, and better**

I believe in building with clarity, engineering with empathy, and thinking in systems.
