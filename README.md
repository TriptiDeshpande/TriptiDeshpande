## 🎯 What Drives Me

My motivation stems from a strong interest in **how intelligent embedded systems impact human safety** in modern mobility. I’m deeply passionate about:

- **Designing robust embedded systems for real-time applications**
- **Bridging the gap between software functionality and functional safety**
- **Learning how systems think — and helping them think safer, faster, and better**

I believe in building with clarity, engineering with empathy, and thinking in systems.

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I'm always open to connect with **like-minded engineers**, **collaborate on embedded systems projects**, or contribute to **real-world safety-critical automotive software development**.

If you're building something meaningful at the intersection of **embedded software, automotive systems, and safety**, let's talk.

> _"I’m here to solve problems, grow fast, and engineer systems that matter.”_
